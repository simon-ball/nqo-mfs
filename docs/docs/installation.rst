Installation
============

mfs is written and tested for Python 3.6+. Python 2 and earlier versions of Python 3 are neither tested nor supported. 

mfs can be installed with pip directly from github:

    ``pip install git+https://github.com/simon-ball/nqo-mfs``

mfs is not available via Conda

Alternately, mfs can be used from source-code by cloning the github repository. Dependencies for the code are listed in ``requirements.txt``. Additional dependencies for running the automated test suite are listed in ``requirements-dev.txt``




Troubleshooting
===============
