def rotate_to_dashed_frame(r, theta, phi):
    """
    Rotate the 3-element vector ``r`` around the X-axis by ``phi``, and then
    around the Z-axis by ``theta``
    
    ``theta`` and ``phi`` are *extrinsic* angles, i.e. the angles remain relative
    to the global frame, regardless of how many or what rotations are performed.
    
    The order is relevant, consider the following example, in which we rotate 
    the y-unit-vector ``(0, 1, 0)`` first by ``phi=45째``, and second by
    ``theta=90째`` 
    
    The first rotation, around X, should give us a diagonal in the YZ plane, i.e.
    ``1/sqrt(2) (0, 1, 1)``
    
    The second rotation takes that diagonal, and rotates it around Z into the XZ
    plane, to ``1/sqrt(2) (-1, 0, 1)``
    
    We can process this in two separate, discrete, steps
    
    >>> unit_y = np.array([0,1,0])
    >>> stage_1a = rotate_to_dashed_frame(unit_y, theta=0, phi=np.radians(45))
    >>> stage_1a
    array(0, 0.7071, 0.7071 )
    
    >>> stage_2a = rotate_to_dashed_frame(stage_1a, theta=np.radians(90), phi=0)
    >>> stage_2a
    array(-0.7071, 0, 0.7071)
    
    We can consider what the outcome would be if the rotation occurred in the
    reverse order: i.e. the y-unit-vector rotated first by ``theta=90째`` and
    then by ``phi=45째``
    
    The first rotation, around Z, should give us ``(-1, 0, 0)``
    
    The second rotation, around X, should then have no effect at all, because
    the vector is on the x-axis.
    
    >>> unit_y = np.array([0,1,0])
    >>> stage_1b = rotate_to_dashed_frame(unit_y, theta=np.radians(90), phi=0)
    >>> stage_1b
    array(-1, 0, 0)
    >>> stage_2b = rotate_to_dashed_frame(stage_1b, theta=0, phi=np.radians(45))
    >>> stage_2b
    array(-1, 0, 0)
    
    We can verify that thisfunction behaves in the order shown by the first case
    in two ways
    
    1) by examining the matrix multiplication implemented
    2) By comparing the outcome to the two examples given
        
    >>> rotate_to_dashed_frame(unit_y, theta=np.radians(90), phi=np.radians(45))
    array (-0.7071, 0, 0.7071)
    
    As we can see, the outcome matches the example given first, i.e. X then Y.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    r: array-like
        Vector to rotate, must be 3 elements.
    theta: float
        Angle (in radians) to rotate around the Z-axis
    phi: float
